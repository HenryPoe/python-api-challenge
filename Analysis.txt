	Temperature as expected is absolutely linearly related to latitude, as you get further away from the
equator temperature goes down. The peak between 10 and 20 degrees latitude is quite interesting though.
	The other three measures of weather that we looked at cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed all have
r-squared values low enough when linearly regressed against latitude to conclude that they are not related.
The most interesting one to me is how horizontal the lines are for wind speed in both hemispheres, which 
hints towards thinking that it is equally windy and not across the globe.
	The most interesting thing about the humidity scatter plots are the lack of points in the corners for
very positive latitude and low humidity as well as very negative latitude and low humidity, which could either
be explained by a relative lack of cities in both very positive and negative latitudes or maybe it is more 
humid in those locations.
	However I would be inclined to conclude that there is no sort of relation linear or otherwise between
wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity vs latitude.
